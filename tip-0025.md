# Abstract

If any funds remain after all claims for the Telos Community Rewards Pool have been distributed, they should be transferred to an account that creates free Telos accounts for new users.

# Motivation

Creating free accounts for new users is one of the best uses of available Telos funds, as long as it is not abused. Our promise to create at least 1 million free accounts has met with overwhelming support.

The Telos Contributors Group has created the Telos Community Reward Pool, a fund of 1 million TLOS to be given away to community members as bounties for expanding the reach of Telos through social media and similar community outreach. The rules of the program explain what will happen if more funds are claimed than actually exist. However, it is more likely that some funds, perhaps a significant amount, will remain unclaimed after all TCRP participants have been paid. As there is no provision for what to do with these funds, this TIP proposes that they be dedicated to an account controlled by the block producers (eosio.prods) that creates free new Telos accounts for new users via teclos or a simple portal on telosfoundation.io or the Telos block explorer. This action would have protections against abuse and would be in addition to other free account efforts promoted by the Telos Foundation.

# Rationale

Bringing new users into the Telos system is clearly one of the most beneficial uses for common funds. When the TCRP is fully retired—after all reasonable submissions have been received—there is likely to be a surplus of funds in the TCRP account. Using these funds to allow an additional route for new users to join the Telos chain at no cost is beneficial to both the chain and to the individual users. This can be accomplished in a responsible way that has protections against abuse.

In this scenario the surplus TCRP funds would be transferred, 15 days after the final submission deadline for the TCRP program to allow ample time for all participants to claim their rewards, to an account for the creation of free accounts. The Telos developers from Goodblock will create a contract that can be accessed from either teclos or a free account portal on the TelosFoundation.io website, that will create exactly one new address for any existing teclos installation address and no free addresses for addresses already created using the freeaccount. This will provide a reasonable protection against abuse. The suggested implementation is to add this feature to the Telos block explorer that Amplified Telos has built, which already has such functionality for the testnet. Along with the previously described command line abuse protections, the block explorer could provide a Captcha-like control and IP filtering to reduce abuse.

While there may very likely be a benefit to the network from creating ongoing community rewards campaigns, this program currently places a high demand on human resources and no provision has been made for such administration after the launch period. Future programs in this vein would be more appropriate as WPS proposals that include provisions for program administration. This proposal for free accounts is expected to have no administration costs after the initial development.

This mode of free account generation would be separate from other methods such as a Telos Foundation grant or WPS proposal. Although if this proves popular, more funds could be allocated to the account through either of these methods to continue the program after the initial funds are depleted.

# Specifications

1. Create an account called ‘freetelosact’ controlled by eosio.prods. 

2. Stipulate that after the completion and payout of Telos Community Rewards, all remaining funds shall be transferred to ‘freetelosact’.

3. Develop a smart contract for ‘freetelosact’ with protections against command line (teclos) abuse, but with the provision for privileged portals to access it repeatedly (the official portal).

4. Modify the Telos block explorer by Amplified Telos (and also the one from Telos Madrid if feasible) to create free accounts, after limiting abuse potential with protections such as a Captcha, cookies, and/or IP checking.
